This is a basic webpage build in HTML5.

The web page will display recipes using basic HTML elements, attributes, and so forth.

Once completed, I will have demonstrated the understanding of HTML5 basics, as well as the basics of git, github, and some other basic skills.

Thanks for checking out my project!
